# Raytracer
This is a realtime 3D rendering engine I created in C++ that uses raytracing to render the scene. This is different than the traditional way of rendering games - rasterisation, as it simulates the rays of light bouncing around the scene to create a more realistic looking scene. The reason raytracing is not normally used in games is because it is quite demanding on the GPU and requires a more high end computer. Raytracing is used in CGI in movies however, as they don't need to be rendered in realtime.
